This program might not be perfect (I know it's not I just don't have the time to make it better), if you have some suggestions feel free to let me know.
the matchups are based on the guide made by HeyRandoms / Feralan.
To make it simpler to correct and read, I made the matchups symetric, thus why Abathur has 17 matchups and Zagara only 1, because all the Zagara matchups are contained in the commanders before her.
Same goes with all commanders, the further they are in the alphabet, the less matchups with themselves they contain, so don't be surprised if you can only modify the Abathur vs Zagara matchup in the "ABATHUR MATCHUPS" section.
Have fun with this tool !
